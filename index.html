        We made this website for our Kode with Klossy Final Project, and we hope that it can be useful to you.
        Our Mission is to inform voters, and citizens participating in the 2020 presidential election
        to become more knowledgable about each candidate running, help reveal their stance, 
        and hopefully to encourage everyone of legal age to get out there, and vote for a president 
        who will best represent you. We hope you can use our website to look more into candidates for
        the election and take action to vote.
