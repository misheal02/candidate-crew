      <p>    
      Over the last three years, the Trump administration has implemented a number of punitive policies intended to curb immigration, but asylum seekers are still flocking to the U.S. in near-record numbers. They’re fleeing poverty and violence, only to find themselves packed into detention centers, sometimes without their children.
      At the same time, the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. live under threat of mass deportations.
      Every contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination has come out against Trump’s hard-line immigration policies to some degree, and not a single one supports family separation, wants to restrict asylum protections, or has called for more deportations. Most of the Immigrants entering the US are from Central and South America. 
      The Detention Centers in border states have been discovered to have inhumane condition, even to the point as children are not given soap or blankets. Immigration is a main topic in the 2020 election, with the increase of immigrants and will definelty plan a big roll in policies announcements.

  <h2 id = "guns">Gun Control</h2>
  <p id = "gunpara">
In 2019 alone there have been more than 150 mass shootings. 8 of these have occured in schools. People all over the nation are calling for Gun Control in our country. One of the biggest arguments, is the 2nd Amendment, the Right to Bear Arms, many people interpret this as they are allowed to have as many guns as they want. Many candidates and people are calling for
Universal Background Checks and the ban of semi-automatic and automatic weapons, along with high-capactiy magazines. These are the weapons that have been used in Churches, Schools and Synagouges to commit these shootings. A large misunderstanding is most people believe in Gun Control, and few in a Gun Ban. With Gun Control; you are still allowed to own weaposn of your choice
and can still legally conseal them. The only difference is control pushes for Universal Background Checks and ban of some very intense weapons. One of the largest issues in the topic is mental illness. People belive that our world is unsafe when people with Mental Illnese have quick access to guns.

        We are putting Tax Money into Education, and not getting good enough results. Taxpayers in 2015 spent $649 Billion on Education. Many districts experience budget cuts due to lack of federal funding. State taxes make more of an impact on Education, they provide 91% of funding for education. States on average spend $12,000 per student. One of the biggest polcies among Democrats is
      having Tuition-Free College and Universal Pre-K. Many countries in Europe, such as Sweden, offer these. Many peoples concerned about this is because of the higher taxes they would have to pay for this, and they are resistant for that.
